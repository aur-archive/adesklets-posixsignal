-This is nothing but a forward port from older python code by Lance Ellinghaus,
-Guido van Rossum & al., reformatted and put back together by Sylvain Fourmanoit <syfou@users.sourceforge.net>
-for recent (2.2.0 final and newer) python implementations.
-
-The ability to temporarily delay signals delivery is a very usefull feature -
-not all C functions are reentrant (in fact, only a few need to be 'safe' 
-according to the POSIX 1003.1-2003 list), so being able to create critical
-code sections is a must. Although I am convinced Python's developpers 
-had good reasons, I do not know myself why 'sigprocmask' and associated 
-functions support was dropped from the signal module on systems which 
-implemented them... Since I needed them in my blissful ignorance, 
-here they are, alive and kicking. :-)
